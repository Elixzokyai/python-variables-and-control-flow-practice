# Variables assignment and arithmetic operations
# write a program that assigns two numbers to variables a and b. Perform the following
# addition
# subtraction
# multiplication
# division

# Assign values to variables a and b
a = 10
b = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b  # This will give a float result

# Print results
print('addition of a and b:',addition)
print('subtraction of a and b:', subtraction)
print('multiplication of a and b:', multiplication)
print('division of a and b:', division)
